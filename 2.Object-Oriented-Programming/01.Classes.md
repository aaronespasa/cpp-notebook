# Classes

Classes evolved from a related type called *structures* or *structs*.



The goal of classes allow programmers **to build user-defined types**. Say for example a mathematician that needs to work with complex numbers, matrices that can perform multiplication with just one command, etc. It would be much more easier for that person to have a **data type** called **matrices** with all the necessary operations. That's where classes come into play.



It's good to mention that the name of <u>classes</u> come from a programming language called **Simula**. And the creator of C++ (Bjarne) decided to follow naming them like so instead of changing their name to **datatype** for example.

# C++ Notes (Theoretical and Practical content)

## How to read the notes

 I recommend 3 different programs depending on the filetype:

- **Notebooks (.ipynb)**: You can view the files from GitHub. However, if you wanna run the code, I recommend using [Jupyter online](https://jupyter.org/try) with the C++ kernel. Just download the repo and upload the files to run them from the browser.
- **C++ files (.cpp & .h)**: I prefer to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **Markdown (.md)**: I use Typora with the [Cobalt theme](https://theme.typora.io/theme/cobalt/).

## File Organization

I use the same organization as the [C++ course in Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).

1. [**Foundations**](https://github.com/aaronespasa/cpp-notebook/tree/main/1.Foundations)
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Astar_progress_animation.gif" />

   - **Introduction**: Language basics, vectors, printing, reading files, etc.
   - **A\* Search**: As we learn about arrays, functions,etc. we'll use this knowledge to develop an A* Search algorithm.
   - **CMake** for writing multifile programs. 
2. [**Object-Oriented Programming**](https://github.com/aaronespasa/cpp-notebook/tree/main/2.Object-Oriented-Programming)
3. [**Memory Management**](https://github.com/aaronespasa/cpp-notebook/tree/main/3.Memory-Management)
4. [**Concurrency**](https://github.com/aaronespasa/cpp-notebook/tree/main/4.Concurrency)

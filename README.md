# C++ Notebooks
*Here I'll be uploading almost all the knowledge I am learning from C++.*

## How to read the notes

 I recommend 3 different programs depending on the filetype:

- **Notebooks (.ipynb)**: You can view the files from GitHub. However, if you wanna run the code, I recommend using [Jupyter online](https://jupyter.org/try) with the C++ kernel. Just download the repo and upload the files to run them from the browser.
- **C++ files (.cpp & .h)**: I prefer to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **Markdown (.md)**: I use Typora with the [Cobalt theme](https://theme.typora.io/theme/cobalt/).

## Organization

I use the same organization as the [C++ course in Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).

1. **Foundations**
2. **Object-Oriented Programming**
3. **Memory Management**
4. **Concurrency**

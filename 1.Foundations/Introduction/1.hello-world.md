# Hello World

To execute the code of the `hello-world.cpp` file, first we've to compile the file.

Open your terminal (make sure you're in the `1.Foundations/Introduction` folder) and type (without the $):

## Compile the file

```bash
$ g++ -o hello-world.exe hello-world.cpp
```

The flag `-o` creates an executable with the name `hello-world.exe` instead of `a.out` by using the file `hello-world.cpp`.



## Execute the code

A new file called `hello-world.exe` will be created. This is the executable. You can now run it as follows:

```bash
$ ./hello-world.exe
```

Now, you will see the message `Hello World!` in terminal!

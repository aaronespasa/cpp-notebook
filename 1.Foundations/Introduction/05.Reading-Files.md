# File Input Streams

In C++, you can use the std::ifstream object to handle input file streams. To do this, you will need to include the header file that provides the file streaming classes: `<fstream>`.



## Creating an Input Stream Object

Create a `std::ifstream` object using the path to your file (`my_file.open(path)`)



## Reading an Input Stream Object

Make sure you evaluate the `std::ifstream` object as a `bool` to ensure that the stream creation did not fail (if statement).



Use a while loop with `getline(ifstream_file, string_variable)` to write file lines to a string.
